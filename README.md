Sudoku Generator

A Sudoku puzzle is a logic-based number-placement game. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.


Here I have used a 2D vector to implement a 9X9 grid which is filled with values from another vector using a backtracking algorithm.
